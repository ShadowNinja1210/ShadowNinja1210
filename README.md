## About Me

I am a passionate web developer with a focus on full-stack development. I have acquired skills in MERN Stack, NextJS and still learning more and making projects to polish my skills. I enjoy creating dynamic and interactive web applications and constantly strive to expand my knowledge and skills in the field.
